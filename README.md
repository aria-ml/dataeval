## About DataEval

<!-- start tagline -->

DataEval curates datasets to train and test performant, robust, unbiased and reliable AI models and monitors for data shifts that impact performance of deployed models. 

<!-- end tagline -->

### Our mission

<!-- start needs -->

DataEval is an effective, powerful, and reliable set of tools for any T&E engineer. Throughout all stages of the machine learning lifecycle, DataEval supports **model development, data analysis, and monitoring with state-of-the-art algorithms to help you solve difficult problems. With a focus on computer vision tasks, DataEval provides simple, but effective metrics for performance estimation, bias detection, and dataset linting.

<!-- end needs -->

<!-- start JATIC interop -->
DataEval is easy to install, supports a wide range of Python versions, and is compatible with many of the most popular packages in the scientific and T&E communities.
DataEval also has native interopability between JATIC's suite of tools when using MAITE-compliant datasets and models.

## Getting Started

**Python versions:** 3.9 - 3.12

**Supported packages**: *NumPy*, *Pandas*, *Sci-kit learn*, *MAITE*, *NRTK*, *Gradient*

Choose your preferred method of installation below or follow our [installation guide](https://dataeval.readthedocs.io/en/v0.74.2/installation.html).

* [Installing with pip](#installing-with-pip)
* [Installing with conda/mamba](#installing-with-conda)
* [Installing from GitHub](#installing-from-github)

### **Installing with pip**
You can install DataEval directly from pypi.org using the following command.  The optional dependencies of DataEval are `all`.

```
pip install dataeval[all]
```

### **Installing with conda**

DataEval can be installed in a Conda/Mamba environment using the provided `environment.yaml` file.  As some dependencies
are installed from the `pytorch` channel, the channel is specified in the below example.

```
micromamba create -f environment\environment.yaml -c pytorch
```

### **Installing from GitHub**

To install DataEval from source locally on Ubuntu, you will need `git-lfs` to download larger, binary source files and `poetry` for project dependency management.

```
sudo apt-get install git-lfs
pip install poetry
```

Pull the source down and change to the DataEval project directory.
```
git clone https://github.com/aria-ml/dataeval.git
cd dataeval
```

Install DataEval with optional dependencies for development.
```
poetry install --all-extras --with dev
```

Now that DataEval is installed, you can run commands in the poetry virtual environment by prefixing shell commands with `poetry run`, or activate the virtual environment directly in the shell.
```
poetry shell
```
