# DataEval

## About DataEval

DataEval focuses on characterizing image data and its impact on model performance across Classification and object-detection tasks.

<!-- start about -->

**Model-agnostic metrics that bound real-world performance**
- relevance/completeness/coverage
- metafeatures (data complexity)

**Model-specific metrics that guide model selection and training**
- dataset sufficiency
- data/model complexity mismatch

**Metrics for post-deployment monitoring of data with bounds on model performance to guide retraining**
- dataset-shift metrics
- model performance bounds under covariate shift
- guidance on sampling to assess model error and model retraining

## Getting Started

### Requirements
- Python 3.9-3.11

### Installing DataEval

You can install DataEval directly from pypi.org using the following command.  The optional dependencies of DataEval are `torch`, `tensorflow` and `all`.  Using `torch` enables Sufficiency metrics, and `tensorflow` enables OOD Detection.

```
pip install dataeval[all]
```

### Installing DataEval in Conda/Mamba

DataEval can be installed in a Conda/Mamba environment using the provided `environment.yaml` file.  As some dependencies
are installed from the `pytorch` channel, the channel is specified in the below example.

```
micromamba create -f environment\environment.yaml -c pytorch
```

### Installing DataEval from GitHub

To install DataEval from source locally on Ubuntu, you will need `git-lfs` to download larger, binary source files and `poetry` for project dependency management.

```
sudo apt-get install git-lfs
pip install poetry
```

Pull the source down and change to the DataEval project directory.
```
git clone https://github.com/aria-ml/dataeval.git
cd dataeval
```



Install DataEval with optional dependencies for development.
```
poetry install --all-extras --with dev
```

Now that DataEval is installed, you can run commands in the poetry virtual environment by prefixing shell commands with `poetry run`, or activate the virtual environment directly in the shell.
```
poetry shell
```
