    "## _Problem Statement_\n",
    "\n",
    "For most computer vision tasks like **image classification** and **object detection**, the size of the image datasets can put an enormous strain on the speed of dataset analysis methods. A way to lessen this burden is to reduce the size of the images without losing the _important_ information. This is known as **dimensionality reduction**. Given the high dimensionality of image data, this is best done using an autoencoder trained on a reconstruction task.\n",
    "\n",
    "To help with this, DAML has introduced a lightweight, easy-to-use Autoencoder Training class ( `AETrainer` ), that allows a user to have out-of-the-box functionality for this type of dimensionality reduction.\n"
