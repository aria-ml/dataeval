Tutorials
=========

These tutorials demonstrate how to use DataEval to perform data analysis tasks using
various detectors, metrics and workflows to assess the suitability of a dataset and/or model.

In addition to viewing them in our documentation, these notebooks can also be opened in Google Colab to be used interactively!
