# Dataset Divergence

## What is it

HP divergence is a nonparametric divergence metric which gives the distance between two datasets. A divergence of 0 means that the two datasets are approximately identically distributed. A divergence of 1 means the two datasets are completely separable.

## When to use it

The `divergence` metric should be used when you would like to know how far two datasets are diverged for one another. For example, if you would like to measure operational drift.
