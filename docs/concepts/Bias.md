# Detecting Bias in Datasets
% Includes Parity, Coverage, Mutual Information, iEAT

## What is it

## When to use it

The `Coverage` class should be used when you have lots of images, but only a small fraction from certain regimes/labels.

The `Parity` class and similar should be used when you would like to determine if two datasets have statistically independent labels.

## Theory behind it
