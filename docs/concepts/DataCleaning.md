# Cleaning Datasets
% Includes the Stats classes, the Linter class and the Duplicates class

## What is it

## When to use it

The Linting class should be used during the initial EDA process or if you are trying to verify that you have the right data in your dataset.

The Duplicates class should be used if you need to check for duplicates in your dataset.

## Theory behind it

There are 3 different methods that the Linter class can use for detecting abnormal images.

- zscore
- modzscore
- iqr

The default value used for the Linter class is `modzscore`.

The [z score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score) method is based on the difference between the data point and the mean of the data.  
The default threshold value for `zscore` is 3.  
Z score $= |x_i - \mu| / \sigma$

The [modified z score](https://www.statology.org/modified-z-score/) method is based on the difference between the data point and the median of the data.  
The default threshold value for `modzscore` is 3.5.  
Modified z score $= 0.6745 * |x_i - xÌƒ| / MAD$, where [$MAD$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_absolute_deviation) is the median absolute deviation

The [interquartile range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range) method is based on the difference between the data point and the difference between the 75th and 25th qartile.  
The default threshold value for `iqr` is 1.5.  
Interquartile range $= threshold * (Q_3 - Q_1)$
