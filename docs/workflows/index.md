# Workflows

## Overview
The Operational Machine Learning Lifecycle has multiple stages that are interwoven to create robust, reliable, and generalizable models.

The workflows described in this document give an overview to the role-specific stages that you might be tasked with. \
It is important to note that these workflows are flexible, and many times multiple hats are needed in a professional setting.

However, at DataEval, we have created a few entry-level guides for common roles found in Data Analytics and Machine Learning to develop the crucial knowledge ones must know to become an expert practiioner.
