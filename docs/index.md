Guides
-------

### [Installation](installation)

If DataEval is not installed, follow this easy [step-by-step guide](installation.md)

### [Quickstart Tutorials](tutorials/index)

We are proud of our tools, so we highlighted common workflows with links so you can try them yourself!

<!-- :doc:`Bayes Error Rate Tutorial<tutorials/notebooks/BayesErrorRateEstimationTutorial>`

We want to show visualizations of tutorials to peak the interest of a potential user
   Might be good to add a BER graph that a user would need (not necessarily from tutorial)
   i.e. A Graph with training accuracy curve, and a BER line (similar to sufficiency) -->

<!--  :doc:`Out-of-Distribution (OOD) Detection Tutorial<tutorials/notebooks/OODDetectionTutorial>`

We want to show visualizations of tutorials to peak the interest of a potential user
   We could show 3 images from a training set class next to 1 that is out-of-dist but classified the same
   Could even make a few rows (multiple classes). -->

DataEval is a powerful toolkit for any data analysis workflow, so be sure to check out the
**Quickstart Tutorials** page for a more comprehensive list of all the tools we offer.

### [Workflows](workflows/index)

Workflows are role-specific guides that give an idea of the types of data analysis that will be done. \
These guides are no-code, basic explanations for people getting started, but want more in-depth understanding!

### [How-To's](how_to/index)

For the more experienced user, or if you are just curious, these guides show different ways
that DataEval's features can be used that might fit operational use more closely
