# How-to Guides

:::{warning}
The How Tos are WIP and are expected to be heavily modified in the future
:::

These guides demonstrate more in-depth features and customizations of DataEval
features for more advanced users.

In addition to viewing them in our documentation, these notebooks can also be
opened in Google Colab to be used interactively!

## Detectors

The purpose of these tools is to identify or detect issues within a dataset.
The guides below exemplify powerful solutions to common problems in ML.

## Metrics

Metrics are a set of tools that measure and analyze data.
The guides below show best practices when solving common ML problems.

## Workflows

Workflows are end-to-end processes that detect, measure,
and analyze data against requirements.
The guides below help you solve common problems found across machine learning tasks.
