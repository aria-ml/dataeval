# Workflows

## Overview

The Operational Machine Learning Lifecycle has multiple stages that are
interwoven to create robust, reliable, and generalizable models.

The workflows described in this document give an overview to the
role-specific stages that you might be tasked with. It is important to note
that these workflows are flexible, and many times multiple hats are needed in
a professional setting.

However, at {term}`DataEval`, we have created a few entry-level guides for
common roles found in Data Analytics and
{term}`machine learning<Machine Learning (ML)>` to develop the crucial
knowledge one must know to become an expert practitioner.

interact, and how they differ from competition-based machine learning life
cycles.
