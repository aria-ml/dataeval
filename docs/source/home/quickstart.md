## Get Started

We are proud of our tools, so we highlighted some simple but powerful
functionality that you can try yourself!

Accurately calculate the maximum performance of your dataset.

<!-- We want to show visualizations of tutorials to peak the interest of a
     potential user. Might be good to add a BER graph that a user would need
     (not necessarily from tutorial) i.e. A Graph with training accuracy curve,
     and a BER line (similar to sufficiency) -->
