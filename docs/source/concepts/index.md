## Workflows

The [Operational Machine Learning Lifecycle](workflows/ML_Lifecycle.md) has
multiple stages that are interwoven to create robust, reliable, and
generalizable models. Here you will learn about each stage, how they
interact, and how they differ from competition-based machine learning life
cycles.

The workflows described in this document give an overview to the
role-specific stages that you might be tasked with. It is important to note
that these workflows are flexible, and many times multiple hats are needed in
a professional setting.

We have created a few entry-level guides for common roles found in Data
Analytics and {term}`machine learning<Machine Learning (ML)>` to develop the
crucial knowledge one must know to become an expert practitioner.
