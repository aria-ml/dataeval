## Key Features

DataEval empowers professionals across domains with tools designed to
enhance their workflows. Explore capabilities specific to your role:

::::{tab-set}

:::{tab-item} T&E Engineer

Maximize your evaluation processes with tools designed
for accuracy and reliability:

- Robust Testing: Reduce errors with metrics that reliably work with state of
  the art image classification and object detection datasets
- Post-Deployment Monitoring: Keep models on track with
  easy-to-implement logging of {term}`Operational Drift` metrics
- Responsive metrics: Optimize evaluation with tailored guidance for error
  assessment and retraining.

:::{tab-item} ML Engineer

Accelerate model development with powerful insights for training and deployment:

- Model-Specific Metrics: Evaluate dataset {term}`Sufficiency` and detect
  data/model complexity mismatches.
- Performance Optimization: Establish bounds on real-world model performance
  for improved training strategies.
- Drift Detection: Rapidly diagnose model degradation under
  {term}`Operational Drift` to maintain model accuracy and stability.

:::{tab-item} Data Scientist

Drive innovation with data-focused tools that uncover hidden patterns and
complexities:

- Metafeatures: Leverage metrics to analyze data complexity and improve
  data-driven decisions based on metadata features.
- Real-World Insights: Improve dataset sampling and improve
  {term}`Balance`, {term}`Completeness`, and {term}`Coverage`.
- Error Analysis: Gain actionable feedback to refine datasets and improve
  performance.
- Complete Shift Analysis: Quantify impactful changes in data due to
  [Covariate Shift](./concepts/Drift.md#covariate-shift), {term}`Label Shift`,
  and {term}`Concept Drift` before they impact your model.
