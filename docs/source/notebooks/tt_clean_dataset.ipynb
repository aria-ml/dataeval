    "Through this process, you've learned how to use DataEval's `Outliers` class to identify and analyze images that deviate from the overall distribution of your dataset and DataEval's `Duplicates` class to identify exact and near duplicates. By examining the images flagged by the different metrics, you gained a deeper understanding of potential issues within your dataset. In this tutorial, the following were covered:\n",

    "- **Underrepresented classes** that may require additional data collection.\n",
    "- **Inconsistencies in image characteristics**, such as brightness, sharpness, or size, which could affect model performance.\n",

    "\n",
    "This work has provided a clearer picture of your dataset's strengths and limitations. You are now equipped to make informed decisions about which data points to keep, remove, or augment. For example, you may decide to exclude irrelevant outliers, collect more data for underrepresented scenarios, or address biases that could impact your model's generalizability.\n",
