    "## _Problem Statement_\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification machine learning tasks, there is an _inherent difficulty_ associated with signal to noise ratio in the images. One way of quantifying this difficulty is the Bayes Error Rate, or irreducable error. This metric tells you if it would be _feasible_ to use a given feature set to predict a target variable.\n",

    "### _When to use_\n",
    "\n",
    "The `BER` metric should be used when you would like to measure the feasibility of a machine learning task. For example, if you have an operational accuracy requirement of 80%, and would like to know if this is feasibly achievable given the imagery. A low feasibility score will tell you that the problem you are trying to score cannot be solved with the existing data at the accuracy you desire. This in turn implies that your question does not follow a learnable pattern or that your data is noisy.\n"
