    "\n",
    "Identifying any biases or correlations present in a dataset is essential to accurately interpreting your model's performance and its ability to generalize to new data.\n",
    "A common cause of poor generalization is shortcut learning &mdash; where a model uses secondary or background information to make predictions &mdash; which is enabled or exacerbated by dataset sampling biases.\n",
    "Understanding biases or correlations present in your dataset is a key component to creating meaningful data splits.\n",
    "Bias in data can lead to misleading conclusions and poor model performance on operational data.\n",
    "There are many different [types of bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.09635).\n",
    "A few of these biases occur during data collection, others occur during dataset development, others occur during model development, while others are a result of the user.\n",
    "This guide does not focus on elminiating all bias. It focuses on identifying the bias that can be found when developing a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "DataEval has three dedicated methods for identifying and understanding the bias or correlations that may be present in a dataset, the `balance`, `diversity` and `parity` functions.\n",
    "The balance function measures correlational relationships between metadata factors and classes by calculating the mutual information between the metadata factors and the labels.\n",
    "The diversity function measures the evenness or uniformity of the sampling of metadata factors over a dataset using the inverse Simpson index or Shannon index.\n",
    "The parity function measures the relationship between metadata factors and classes using a chi-squared test.\n",
    "\n",
    "These techniques help ensure that when you split the data for your projects, you minimize things like shortcut learning and leakage between training and testing sets.\n"
