# DataEval Tutorials

The tutorials on this page aim to teach important concepts one can come across
as a machine learning testing and evaluation engineer through easy-to-follow
examples that are handcrafted to give you the best experience possible.

The tutorials are split into sections based on which stage they fall under in
the [machine learning life cycle](../concepts/workflows/ML_Lifecycle.md).
Currently, there are tutorials for the following stages:

1. [Data engineering](#data-engineering)
2. [Monitoring](#monitoring)

More tutorials are always in development, but you can suggest specific
tutorials by [requesting a topic](../home/contributing.md).

* - [](../notebooks/tt_clean_dataset.ipynb)
  - Learn about the impacts of unstructured, raw data and how to transform it
    into a reliable, robust dataset.
  - [![Open In Colab][colab-badge]][eda-colab]
* - [](../notebooks/tt_assess_data_space.ipynb)
  - Learn how to fix and prevent gaps in data to develop more reliable and
    robust models.
  - [![Open In Colab][colab-badge]][dataspace-colab]
* - [](../notebooks/tt_identify_bias.ipynb)
  - Learn how correlations in your data and metadata can affect model
    performance and what can be done to remove that bias.
