% Dataset Stats

% ============================

% The basic Dataset Stats class assists with exploratory dataset analysis (EDA).

% The class delivers stats for the following aspects of images:

% * height

% * width

% * size

% * aspect ratio

% * number of channels

% * pixel value range

% * mean pixel value

% * missing values (NaNs)

% * number of 0 value pixels

% * pixel variance

% * pixel skew

% * pixel kurtosis

% * max/min pixel value along with the 25th and 75th percentiles

% * overall brightness of the image

% * blurriness of the image

% * entropy of the image

% The above stats are also calculated on a per channel basis if the images have more than one channel.

% This class can be used to determine if there are any issues with any of the images in the dataset.

% As well as give a big picture view of how similar the images are to one another.
