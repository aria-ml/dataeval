<!--
Documentation Concept Page Issue Template

This template is to be used when a new feature has been completed. \
All code that will be released should have a concepts page in the docs/concepts folder.
All new features should have at least a tutorial, concept page, and reference page. How-tos are optional.

 
This page is to be used to explain in detial everything about the new function (code).
The Definition of Done lists the different templated sections, but you are not constrained to those sections.
You may adjust them as needed to best discuss the new feature.\
This page should include links to all other documentation pages for this feature.
