    "## _Problem Statement_\n",
    "\n",
    "In computer vision tasks like **image classification** and **object detection**, when OOD examples are detected, there are two things we might like to know about them. First of all, looking at each example as an individual, what makes it stand out from the reference dataset? Second, as a population, what about them has shifted the most relative to the reference dataset? Metadata can help address both of these things.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first, we can look at the values of each metadata feature of each example, and find which lies furthest out in the tails of the reference distribution. Since we are interested in extreme values, we should take the median of each reference feature, and then find the absolute deviation of each OOD example's from that median. (We can store the sign if we wish, but we should evaluate significance in terms of absolute deviation). In order to compare between features, we will normalize deviations by the inter-quartile range of each feature's reference distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the second, we can compare the distribution of each feature to the reference using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. For features which show a statistically significant difference, we can use the Wasserstein to measure it (again, normalized by the IQR of the reference).\n"
