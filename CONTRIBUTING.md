## How Can I Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

Bug reports can be submitted in several forms.  Here are some general guidelines to keep in mind when submitting
a bug report for consideration.

#### Crafting a Bug Report

```

#### Submitting a Bug Report

Bugs are tracked via issues in our internal GitLab repository, but issues can be reported via GitHub or by emailing us at dataeval@ariacoustics.com.  For issues created in GitHub, please follow the above bug report template.

#### Making it Good(tm)

Bugs can be notoriously difficult to pin down and eliminate, but following the tips below can help the maintainers do the best they can.

- Use a clear and descriptive title
- Describe the exact steps (before and during) which led to the issue
- Provide specific examples (such as data inputs or models used)
- Describe the behavior observed after following each step
- Explain what was the expected behavior compared to what was observed
- Include full callstacks and error messages when possible
